# MoneyManager
This project focuses on developing an online banking system. The main aim is 
to  create  an  online  banking  platform  that  is  accessible  from  any  location,  so 
customers need not go to the bank branches for routine banking operations like 
money withdrawal, money transfer, balance inquiry, etc. 
Visiting  the  physical  branches  of  banks  is  not  only  time  consuming  but  can 
also be hectic, thanks to long queues and waiting time. Not to forget, running 
to banks for every minor banking task creates an unnecessary burden on bank 
staff. The frontend is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Supported by a Spring
Boot backend that connects to a MySQL database.
